    "text": "Evolution of Beyonce’s Album\nFor my final project, I will be exploring the evolution of Beyonce’s albums by analyzing the trend of sentiment scores. The data used in this project includes the names of albums, titles of song, song lyrics and release year of album (link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hillaryosei/beyonce-lyrics?resource=download). Another dataset, which I will be making myself, simply shows the number of copies sold for each album (raw data: https://www.forbes.com/sites/marisadellatto/2022/08/08/beyoncs-renaissance-is-a-no-1-album-but-its-not-her-biggest-debut-ever/?sh=599029c227d5)\nMy motivation for selecting this dataset is two-fold: a) Beyonce is one of the most legendary artists of the century with her career spanning over 20 years. Therefore, I believe that she would be an interesting topic of a project. b) Throughout the DH 140 course, I particularly enjoyed text analysis and data visualization. Thus, I want to use these two techniques primarily. With these reasons in mind, my research question is this:\nHow have the moods of Beyonce’s albums transformed over the span of her career and what is the correlation between moods and sales of her album?\n\nI.

Since each album was released in different year, I can simply distinguish album based on the year column. Below, I created a small dataset that only has the track_num and year columns:\n\nbeyonce_file.loc[:,['track_num','year']]\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      track_num\n      year\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      1\n      2003\n    \n    \n      1\n      1\n      2003\n    \n    \n      2\n      1\n      2003\n    \n    \n      3\n      1\n      2003\n    \n    \n      4\n      1\n      2003\n    \n    \n      ...\n      ...\n      ...\n    \n    \n      6151\n      16\n      2022\n    \n    \n      6152\n      16\n      2022\n    \n    \n      6153\n      16\n      2022\n    \n    \n      6154\n      16\n      2022\n    \n    \n      6155\n      16\n      2022\n    \n  \n\n6156 rows × 2 columns\n\n\n\nHowever, since there are 6156 rows, it is impossible to clearly see the number of tracks in each album. Thus, I decided to create a variable for each album and with that, it would be very easy to quickly grasp the result. First, let’s get the list of all the albums:\n\nprint(beyonce_file['album'].drop_duplicates())\n\n0       Dangerously in Love\n914                   B'Day\n1884    I Am...Sasha Fierce\n2495                      4\n3451                BEYONCÉ\n4349               Lemonade\n4966            RENAISSANCE\nName: album, dtype: object\n\n\nBelow are the basic info of each album.
